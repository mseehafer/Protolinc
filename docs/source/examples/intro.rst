Examples
==========================


When trying out the examples result files in .csv-format are created. To work with them
one can copy the file *results_viewer_generic_template.xlsx* from the examples directory
into each of the subdirectories **and** - if working in the repository - relabel it to
*results_viewer_generic.xlsx*.
